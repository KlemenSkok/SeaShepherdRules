# Basic program structure
### (By ChatGPT)

1. Main Functionality:
- <u>Main.cpp:</u> This file contains the main function where the program starts execution. It initializes the game, sets up the game loop, and handles input events.

2. **Game Loop:**

- <u>Game.cpp and Game.h:</u> Implement the game loop and overall game logic. This class should handle initialization, updating game state, rendering, and cleanup. It may contain instances of other classes responsible for specific game features.

3. **Rendering:**

- <u>Renderer.cpp and Renderer.h:</u> Encapsulate the rendering functionality using SDL2. This class might include functions for drawing sprites, handling textures, and managing the rendering pipeline.

4. **Input Handling:**

- <u>InputManager.cpp and InputManager.h:</u> Handle keyboard, mouse, and other input events. This class can abstract SDL input functions and provide a cleaner interface to the rest of the game.

5. **Entities and Game Objects:**
- <u>Entity.cpp and Entity.h:</u> Define a base class for game entities. Entities could represent characters, objects, enemies, etc. Each entity can have its own logic for updating and rendering.

6. **Player and Enemies:**
- <u>Player.cpp and Player.h:</u> Implement player-specific functionality.
- <u>Enemy.cpp and Enemy.h:</u> Implement enemy-specific functionality.

7. **Collision Detection:**

- <u>CollisionManager.cpp and CollisionManager.h:</u> Manage collision detection between different game entities. This class can use bounding boxes or other techniques to handle collisions.
  
8. **Game State Management:**
- <u>GameState.cpp and GameState.h:</u> If your game has different states (e.g., menu, playing, game over), create a class to manage the current state and handle state transitions.

9. **Resource Management:**
- <u>ResourceManager.cpp and ResourceManager.h:</u> Manage game assets like textures, sounds, and fonts. This class can load and unload resources efficiently.
  
10. **Utilities:**

- <u>Utilities.cpp and Utilities.h:</u> Include utility functions that are commonly used throughout the game, such as math functions, random number generation, etc.

11. **Configuration:**

- <u>Config.cpp and Config.h:</u> Manage game configurations and settings, allowing easy tweaking without modifying the code.

12. **Constants:**

- <u>Constants.h:</u> Define constants such as screen dimensions, frame rate, and other game-specific constants.
